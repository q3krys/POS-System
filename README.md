# **Basic POS System (Python)**

This is a Point of Sale (POS) system that I developed as part of my college NEA project.

The backend is primarily based on Codebasics' Grocery Store Application, with additional custom features and functionality built by me. Note that the database isn't included. However, you can easily modify the connection in the `sql_connection.py` file. Keep in mind that many of the database key names are referenced in the JavaScript files, so you might want to go through and use "find and replace" there to help you out.

## **Key Features:**
- Custom Order Page
- Order History Page

## **How to Use**
(Note, this assumes you have setup your own database connection and have corrected any references as necessary)
1. Launch server.py either by itself or through your IDE of choice
2. Connect to the Flask IP in your browser (Usually runs on http://127.0.0.1:5000)
3. Use as needed.
